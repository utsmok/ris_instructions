> ORCID, which stands for **[Open Researcher and Contributor ID](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973993-What-is-ORCID-)**, is a free, unique, persistent identifier (PID) for individuals to use as they engage in research, scholarship, and innovation activities. We provide ORCID to researchers free of charge so that we may realize our vision of connecting all who participate in research, scholarship, and innovation are uniquely identified and connected to their contributions across disciplines, borders, and time.

> People use “ORCID” or “ORCID iD” interchangeably, but what they’re talking about is a [16-digit number](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897674-Structure-of-the-ORCID-Identifier) _and_ the associated record (sometimes called a profile) that stores automatic links to all your research, and links all your research with you. By allowing trusted organizations to add your research information to your ORCID record, you can spend more time conducting your research and less time managing it.

>The ORCID iD is an https URI with a 16-digit number that is compatible with the ISO Standard ([ISO 27729](https://www.iso.org/standard/44292.html)), also known as the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI), e.g. https://orcid.org/0000-0001-2345-6789
>
>The ORCID iD is expressed as an https URI, i.e. the 16-digit identifier is preceded by "https://orcid.org/". A hyphen is inserted every 4 digits of the identifier to aid readability.
>
>When stored, the ORCID iD should be expressed as a full https URI: https://orcid.org/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx, complete with the protocol (https://), and with hyphens in the identifier (xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx).

>Below are some example ORCID iDs with checksums as described above and expressed in the proper format.
