From https://www.doi.org:
> A DOI (*Digital Object Identifier*) name is a digital identifier of an object, any object â€” physical, digital, or abstract. DOIs solve a common problem: keeping track of things. Things can be matter, material, content, or activities. 

A DOI comes in 2 forms. The base form is the number consisting of a prefix & suffix, like so:

10.1000/182

The URL-form prepends this with https://doi.org/. If you visit this link, you should end up at the item that is linked to this DOI. This is the URL-form of the example DOI:

https://doi.org/10.1000/182

All DOIs start with 10. and contain a single slash. When entering a DOI in Pure or elsewhere, you can use either form.
