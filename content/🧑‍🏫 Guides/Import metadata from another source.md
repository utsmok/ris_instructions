Besides manually entering data, you can retrieve metadata from various sources. Several can be set up to automatically notify you when a new work has been found that is attributed to you.

We highly recommend setting up the automatic search functionality of Pure to easily import your research output. A detailed guide on how to do so can be found [[Automated metadata search|here]].

Pure has the ability to import research output and datasets from the following databases:

|      **Source**       |        **Type**        | **Autosearch** |          **Link**           |
| :-------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------: | :-------------------------: |
|        Scopus         |  Mainly Publications   |    ✓ - Yes     |       www.scopus.com        |
|       Espacenet       |        Patents         |    ✓ - Yes     |    https://espacenet.com    |
|         arXiv         |       Preprints        |    ✓ - Yes     |      https://arxiv.org      |
|         ORCID         |          All           |    ✓ - Yes     |      https://orcid.org      |
|       Crossref        |  Mainly Publications   |     ❌ - No     |      www.crossref.org       |
|      IEEE Xplore      |  Mainly Publications   |     ❌- No      | https://ieeexplore.ieee.org |
| Mendeley Data Monitor | Mainly Data & Software |     ❌ - No     |  https://data.mendeley.com  |

## Which service should I use?

We recommend using Scopus. Explanations and details can be read by expanding the items below.
Reminder: if you want to enable automatic import, you can find the [[Automated metadata search|guide for setting it up here]].
## Do not enable more than 1 automatic import service!
> [!danger]- Do not enable more than 1 automatic import service!
> If you enable multiple automatic import services you will run into issues. Because the different databases will supply their data in different ways it's difficult for Pure to immediately detect duplicate items. Although you're always able to choose which data to add and fix any errors in metadata, it's easy to make a mistake and pollute the database. If you want to know more details about the various import sources, read the text below.
## Why is Scopus recommended?
> [!tip]- Why is Scopus recommended?
> Scopus will include the most complete and correct metadata of the available options. This is partly because Scopus and Pure are both Elsevier products, which enables them to fully integrate both services. The second best option to use is [[Crossref]]: most published academic work will have a [[DOI]] registered by Crossref. However, this often won't include as much metadata as an import through Scopus, so you'll have to add any missing data afterwards. 
## Importing from preprint and patent databases
>[!faq]- Importing from preprint and patent databases
> arXiv and Espacenet are databases with a more narrow scope; the former exclusively hosts [[Preprint|preprints]], and the latter is a [[Patent|patents]] database. Both patents and preprints are also indexed by Scopus, so it might feel redundant to use these. However, arXiv and Espacenet will probably have better coverage compared to Scopus, depending on various factors. The available metadata will also be different, so they can be a valuable source for more information.
## Import works from previous employment
> [!faq]- I recently started at the UT. Can I import research that I've done at other universities into Pure?
> Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Please see the [QRCs on the Service Portal](https://www.utwente.nl/en/service-portal/research-support/procedures-facilities/research-information-system-ris#quick-reference-cards) for more details. If you have an up-to-date [[Registering your ORCID|ORCID]] profile, an easy way is to use the ORCID automatic import option in Pure to transfer over your data.
