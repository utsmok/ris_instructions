[QRC - Automated Search Profiles](https://www.utwente.nl/.uc/fd9ba7e810102f560d501c66af50355167e636a0f70f200/QRC-Automated%20Search%20profiles.pdf) contains the instructions for setting up automated search profiles.. The contents of the QRC have been replicated below.

> [!danger]- Pay attention to the item category when importing from arXiv!
> When you import a preprint from arXiv, it will be registered in our RIS as a *working paper*, which isn't monitored as part of your main research output. If this preprint is import to your output make sure to change the category to a more appropriate one. See the [[Preprint|preprint manual]] on this site for more information.

## Setting up automated import in Pure
In Pure it is possible to automatic import your publications from a number of sources into Pure These so called “search profiles” are activated from your personal profile page. Click the ‘edit profile’ button on your personal overview page. ![img_p0_4](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p0_4.png)![img_p0_5](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p0_5.png)
In the left navigation pane, click Automated search, this will open the page where you can set up your automated search.
![img_p0_6](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p0_6.png)
Now you can enable automated search for your publications for every listed source. To do so, move
the switch to “ON”. You can add a name variant and/or edit the existing name (variants).

N.B. To enable automatic search in Scopus, a Scopus author ID is mandatory!
![img_p1_4](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p1_4.png)
When done enabling the sources you want to use to search for your publications, save your setting by clicking the Save button at the bottom of the page. To avoid duplicates, we strongly advise to limit the number of sources! Pure will now search for online matches in the specified databases on a weekly basis. You will receive an email notification (see: OPTION) on any results. In Pure, you will also see a list of candidates in your personal task list (top right of the screen). Clicking the candidates for a specific set on the screen or in the (optional) mail will take you to a review screen.
![img_p1_5](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p1_5.png)
The review screen will inform you of any potential duplicates; the publication might already be in Pure, if this is the case (please review the duplicate first), import and merge or use the reject button to remove it from your list. Pure will ignore the match from then on. When there are no issues import the publication using the import button.
![img_p1_6](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p1_6.png)
When checking import candidate(s) it is important to open the dropdown menu by clicking the triangle next to it. Choose “import & match”, this gives you an overview of the matching options, and enables you to choose the option which matches best.
![img_p1_7](images/QRC_automated_import/img_p1_7.png)
OPTION: It’s also possible to enable an e‐mail notification when Pure finds candidates.

**Help and Support**
More detailed instructions on how to use Pure Research Information are available in the Pure manual. Access the manual from the bottom right corner of the screen at any time when logged into Pure Research Information. (hover over ‘Help and support’, click Manual’) The available manuals are based on your role (researcher, editor) in Pure. Also a link to the FAQ’s is listed here to help you make the best use of Pure Research Information.

## Troubleshooting
TODO:  what to do when things go wrong: import doesnt work, metadata is wrong, etc 

## Import a single item
You can also search for single items in other databases through Pure in order to import the metadata. This function includes more data sources compared to the automatic import.
