These items are relatively short in length; mostly between 5 and 20 pages. Articles published in non-scientific journals, like trade journals, require setting some different options — read the Non-scientific journal article page for more information.\nImportant unique identifiers\nUnique identifiers are crucial for correct data entry. Make sure to always check that these are filled in correctly when adding an item to Pure.\nIn almost all cases, a journal article should have a DOI, and  the journal that published the article should have one or two ISSNs.  It’s also helpful to look up (or register) ORCIDs - not only for yourself, but for any person related to this item.\nAlternative options\nIf the item you want to add does not fit with the definition of a journal article, here are a few links to items that might be better suited:\n\nConference article\nPreprint\nOther journal contributions\nBook chapter\n\nFor a complete overview of item types, see Overview of items. If you need additional support, please contact us.\nAdding a journal article to the RIS\nIf you’ve never added an item to Pure before, it’s advised to first read the page Getting started with Pure\nCategory\nJournal articles should be registered using the following category:\nResearch Output → Contribution to journal → Article.\n\nThe list of items in the category ‘Contribution to journal’ has a few categories that also look  fitting for certain journal articles; however, only the ‘Article’ category is taken into consideration for analysis and reports on journal articles.\nSo, please do not add items to the following categories:\n\nBook/Film/Article review\nLiterature review\nReview article\nShort survey\n\nFor information on the use of the category ‘Conference article’, check out that page.\nAnnotated guide\nIn this part, each field and option is explained. The most important information is shown using a screenshot of the form including annotations. Additional notes are available for additional context and explanations where needed.\n\nAdditional notes\nSubtitles\nSubtitles are metadata that aren’t used often in various databases, as they aren’t well-defined. Adding important title data here is not recommended. For example, if your article has a title like this:\n\nMy great journal article\nan explanation of important things related to subject\n\nit’s often best combine this into a single title (and add it to the ‘title’ field):\n\nMy great journal article: an explanation of important things related to subject\n\nor:\n\nMy great journal article, an explanation of important things related to subject\n\nThe best way to avoid issues like this is to not use subtitles in your works at all, of course.\nAutomated import\nsee Import metadata from another source.\nRelations between items\n— text goes here"},"📚-Publications/Journals/Other-journal-contributions":{"title":"Other journal contributions","links":["💻-Data--and--Software/Dataset","💻-Data--and--Software/Research-Software","💻-Data--and--Software/Supporting-Software","🎓-Academic-Activities/Editorial-Work"],"tags":[],"content":"this might also include things like Dataset or Research Software &amp; Supporting Software.\nFor peer-review &amp; editing, see Editorial Work"},"📚-Publications/Non-scientific-journal-article":{"title":"Non-scientific journal article","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"📚-Publications/Preprint":{"title":"Preprint","links":["📚-Publications/Journals/Journal-article"],"tags":[],"content":"describe what it is etc\nlink to other related items as well, like the ‘final’ Journal article if it eventually is published"},"📚-Publications/Thesis":{"title":"Thesis","links":["🎓-Academic-Activities/Supervision"],"tags":[],"content":"see also Supervision if you’re the promotor"},"🔠-Glossary/DOI":{"title":"DOI","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"From www.doi.org:\n\nA DOI (Digital Object Identifier) name is a digital identifier of an object, any object — physical, digital, or abstract.

If this preprint is import to your output make sure to change the category to a more appropriate one. See the preprint manual on this site for more information.\n\n\nSetting up automated import in Pure\nIn Pure it is possible to automatic import your publications from a number of sources into Pure These so called “search profiles” are activated from your personal profile page. Click the ‘edit profile’ button on your personal overview page. \nIn the left navigation pane, click Automated search, this will open the page where you can set up your automated search.\n\nNow you can enable automated search for your publications for every listed source. To do so, move\nthe switch to “ON”. You can add a name variant and/or edit the existing name (variants).\n\nN.B. To enable automatic search in Scopus, a Scopus author ID is mandatory!\n\nWhen done enabling the sources you want to use to search for your publications, save your setting by clicking the Save button at the bottom of the page. To avoid duplicates, we strongly advise to limit the number of sources! Pure will now search for online matches in the specified databases on a weekly basis. You will receive an email notification (see: OPTION) on any results. In Pure, you will also see a list of candidates in your personal task list (top right of the screen). Clicking the candidates for a specific set on the screen or in the (optional) mail will take you to a review screen.\n\nThe review screen will inform you of any potential duplicates; the publication might already be in Pure, if this is the case (please review the duplicate first), import and merge or use the reject button to remove it from your list. Pure will ignore the match from then on. When there are no issues import the publication using the import button.\n\nWhen checking import candidate(s) it is important to open the dropdown menu by clicking the triangle next to it. Choose “import &amp; match”, this gives you an overview of the matching options, and enables you to choose the option which matches best.\n\nOPTION: It’s also possible to enable an e‐mail notification when Pure finds candidates.\n\nHelp and Support\nMore detailed instructions on how to use Pure Research Information are available in the Pure manual. Access the manual from the bottom right corner of the screen at any time when logged into Pure Research Information. (hover over ‘Help and support’, click Manual’) The available manuals are based on your role (researcher, editor) in Pure. Also a link to the FAQ’s is listed here to help you make the best use of Pure Research Information.\n\nTroubleshooting\nTODO:  what to do when things go wrong: import doesnt work, metadata is wrong, etc\nImport a single item\nYou can also search for single items in other databases through Pure in order to import the metadata.

Explanations and details can be read by expanding the items below.\nReminder: if you want to enable automatic import, you can find the guide for setting it up here.\nDo not enable more than 1 automatic import service!\n\n\n                  \n                  Do not enable more than 1 automatic import service! \n                  \n                \n\nIf you enable multiple automatic import services you will run into issues. Because the different databases will supply their data in different ways it’s difficult for Pure to immediately detect duplicate items. Although you’re always able to choose which data to add and fix any errors in metadata, it’s easy to make a mistake and pollute the database. If you want to know more details about the various import sources, read the text below.\n\n\nWhy is Scopus recommended?\n\n\n                  \n                  Why is Scopus recommended? \n                  \n                \n\nScopus will include the most complete and correct metadata of the available options. This is partly because Scopus and Pure are both Elsevier products, which enables them to fully integrate both services. The second best option to use is Crossref: most published academic work will have a DOI registered by Crossref. However, this often won’t include as much metadata as an import through Scopus, so you’ll have to add any missing data afterwards.\n\n\nImporting from preprint and patent databases\n\n\n                  \n                  Importing from preprint and patent databases \n                  \n                \n\narXiv and Espacenet are databases with a more narrow scope; the former exclusively hosts preprints, and the latter is a patents database. Both patents and preprints are also indexed by Scopus, so it might feel redundant to use these. However, arXiv and Espacenet will probably have better coverage compared to Scopus, depending on various factors. The available metadata will also be different, so they can be a valuable source for more information.\n\n\nImport works from previous employment\n\n\n                  \n                  I recently started at the UT. Can I import research that I&#039;ve done at other universities into Pure? \n                  \n                \n\nYes, you can. Yes, you can. Please see the QRCs on the Service Portal for more details. If you have an up-to-date ORCID profile, an easy way is to use the ORCID automatic import option in Pure to transfer over your data.\n\n"},"🧑‍🏫-Guides/Registering-your-ORCID":{"title":"Registering your ORCID","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"todo: explain how to register orcid and link it to pure and elsewhere\nalso why it’s important"}}
